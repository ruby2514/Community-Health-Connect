        <p class="text-muted">
          The Community Health Connect is a web application built to help
          individuals locate local health and social support services such as clinics, food pantries,
          shelters, and mental health resources.
        </p>
        <p class="text-muted">
          By bringing these resources into one place and allowing users to search by location and
          category, the project supports public health goals related to access to care and social
          determinants of health.
